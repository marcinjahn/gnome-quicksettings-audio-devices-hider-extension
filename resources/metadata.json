  "description": "A Gnome Shell extension that allows you to hide selected output/input devices from the Quick Settings audio devices panel.\nThanks to it, your Quick Settings panel will list only those devices that you actually use making it easier to quickly switch between them.\n\nCheck out the https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/6000/quick-settings-audio-devices-renamer/ if you'd rather want to rename some device than hide it.",
